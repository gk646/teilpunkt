Building a secure file database and collaboration platform in C++ with a simple, modern frontend will require the following technology stack. Here’s how to break it down while focusing on doing as much as possible yourself, especially on the backend.
1. Core Backend Technologies (C++)
   Networking

   Use a library to manage HTTP requests and responses:
   Boost.Beast:
   Built on top of Boost.Asio, it provides an HTTP and WebSocket server/client.
   Great for building REST APIs.
   Boost.Beast Documentation
   cpp-httplib:
   Lightweight and easy-to-use alternative for HTTP server/client.
   cpp-httplib GitHub

Database

    Use an embedded database for simplicity or a full RDBMS for scalability:
        SQLite (embedded):
            Best for quick development and self-contained storage.
            SQLite C++ Wrapper
        PostgreSQL (networked):
            A robust relational database with strong security and scalability.
            Library: libpqxx (C++ client for PostgreSQL).
            libpqxx Documentation

Authentication

    Implement modern authentication methods, including:
        Passkeys (FIDO2/WebAuthn):
            Use libfido2 for server-side FIDO2 support.
            libfido2 GitHub
        OAuth/OpenID Connect:
            Library: oatpp-oauth2 for OAuth2.
            For OpenID Connect, consider jwt-cpp for handling JWT tokens.
            jwt-cpp GitHub

Encryption

    Use modern encryption libraries to handle file encryption and secure communication:
        libsodium:
            Lightweight and easy-to-use library for encryption, signatures, and key management.
            libsodium Documentation
        OpenSSL:
            Comprehensive library for cryptographic functions and SSL/TLS.
            OpenSSL Documentation
        bcrypt:
            For password hashing and salting if you need password-based logins.

File Storage

    File storage system options:
        Store files on disk:
            Use structured directories with metadata in your database.
            Ensure encryption before saving files.
        Use object storage:
            Libraries like AWS SDK for C++ to interact with services like S3.
            Self-hosted options like MinIO (can act as an S3-compatible local server).

Logging and Debugging

    Use logging libraries to trace issues:
        spdlog: Fast, header-only C++ logging library.
        spdlog GitHub

2. Frontend Technologies
   Frontend Framework

   Use a modern JavaScript-based UI framework:
   React (Recommended):
   Component-based, simple to set up, and widely used.
   React Documentation
   Vue.js:
   Lightweight and easier to learn.
   Vue.js Documentation
   Svelte:
   Minimalistic and highly performant.
   Svelte Documentation

UI Library

    For pre-styled components and a modern UI:
        Material-UI:
            A React-based library implementing Google’s Material Design.
            Material-UI Documentation
        Bootstrap:
            A classic choice for consistent, responsive designs.
            Bootstrap Documentation

Frontend Authentication

    Use the WebAuthn API for passkeys:
        Integrate using native browser support for FIDO2/WebAuthn.
        WebAuthn Guide

Frontend-Backend Communication

    Communicate with the backend using REST APIs or WebSocket for real-time features:
        Use Axios for HTTP requests.
        Use Socket.IO or the browser’s WebSocket API for real-time interactions.

3. Development Tools
   Build System

   CMake:
   Standard build system for modern C++ projects.
   CMake Documentation

Package Management

    vcpkg:
        Package manager for C++ dependencies.
        vcpkg Documentation

Testing Framework

    Catch2:
        Lightweight unit testing framework for C++.
        Catch2 GitHub

4. Suggested Architecture
   Backend

   Core Features:
   REST API for CRUD operations on files and users.
   Middleware for encryption/decryption.
   Authentication endpoints (passkeys and session management).
   Layers:
   Storage Layer: File system + database.
   Encryption Layer: Handle file encryption/decryption.
   Authentication Layer: Implement secure login methods.
   API Layer: Expose REST endpoints.

Frontend

    Minimal Client:
        Login screen with passkey support.
        File upload/download interface.
        File metadata viewer/editor.

Feature Timeline (1-3 Months)
Month 1:

    Set up backend with C++ (using Boost.Beast or cpp-httplib).
    Implement basic file storage and metadata management.
    Set up frontend with React or Vue.js.

Month 2:

    Add encryption support using libsodium or OpenSSL.
    Integrate WebAuthn for passkeys.
    Add REST endpoints for user authentication and file management.

Month 3:

    Refine UI and add metadata management.
    Add notifications for file access.
    Test and document the project.


# Files

1. Files (Core Entity)

   Name: The file name.
   Size: The file size.
   Content: The actual file data (encrypted).
   Version: Support versioning for files (e.g., "v1", "v2").
   Type: MIME type (e.g., application/pdf, image/jpeg).

2. Folders and Hierarchies

   Add support for folders or directory structures:
   Folder Name: The name of the folder.
   Folder Path: Path to the folder within the hierarchy (e.g., /projects/2025).
   Child Files: Files contained in the folder.
   Parent Folder: Reference to the parent folder.

Why?

    Provides users with an organized way to group and manage files.

3. File Metadata

Extend metadata for files:

    Creation Date: When the file was uploaded.
    Last Modified Date: When the file was last updated.
    Owner: User who uploaded the file.
    Tags: Keywords or labels for easier searching.
    Description: Optional user-provided description of the file.
    Checksum: File hash (e.g., SHA-256) for integrity verification.

4. Access Control Information

   Permissions:
   Who can read/write/delete the file.
   Can include granular roles (e.g., viewer, editor, owner).
   Shared With:
   List of users/groups who have access to the file.
   Audit Log:
   Track actions on the file (e.g., "downloaded by user X at time Y").

5. Users and Groups

   Users:
   Username, email, authentication credentials.
   Roles: e.g., admin, regular user.
   Groups:
   Collections of users for simplified access control.
   Example: "Project A Team" with access to all files in a folder.

6. Links and Sharing

   Shared Links:
   Generate temporary or permanent URLs for file sharing.
   Configure link permissions (e.g., view-only, edit, expiration date).
   Public/Private Settings:
   Mark files or folders as public or private.

7. Data Types Beyond Files

Your application might manage additional types of data:

    Notes:
        Short text-based notes linked to a file or project.
    Projects:
        Group related files and folders into a "project."
    Tasks/To-Dos:
        Associate tasks with files (e.g., "Review this document").
    Links:
        Store URLs or references to external resources.

8. File Previews

   Store and manage file previews or thumbnails for easier identification:
   Images: Generate resized versions for previews.
   Documents: Extract text or first page preview (e.g., for PDFs).

9. Retention Policies

   Manage file lifecycle:
   Expiration Date: Automatically delete files after a set period.
   Archiving: Move old files to an archive location.
   Add support for compliance or organizational rules.

10. Collaborative Features

    Comments:
    Allow users to add comments to files or folders.
    Version History:
    Store previous versions of files for rollback.
    Activity Feed:
    Show recent actions on a file (e.g., "User X edited file Y").

11. Global Settings

    Application-wide settings:
    Storage Quota: Maximum storage allowed per user or group.
    Encryption Settings: Default encryption algorithms or user-specific keys.
    User Policies: Rules for password strength, 2FA, etc.

12. Monitoring and Analytics

    Track usage and provide insights:
    File Statistics:
    Number of downloads or views.
    User Statistics:
    Most active users.
    Storage Metrics:
    Total storage used by a user or group.
